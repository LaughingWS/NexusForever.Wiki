# Contributing

NexusForever is always looking for new developers to contribute in rebuilding Nexus, no contribution is too small!

### Development

Developers are the backbone of the project, they're the ones who reverse-engineer the code to create the server.\
To contribute as a developer, you'll need the following:

* Familiarity with programming languages (ideally **C#** or **C++**).
* Reverse Engineer knowledge and familiarity to software such as IDA Pro or Ghidra.
* Database or game networking knowledge would be a plus!
* A development IDE such as Microsoft Visual Studio, the Community version is free!

### Documentation

If you have a way with words, documentation could be for you! Technical writers take all the information associated with the project and refine it into clear, concise, and easy-to-follow written content.\
To help with documentation, you'll want to have:

* A strong grasp of English grammar, usage, and mechanics.
* Some familiarity with technical writing and internal/external documentation.
* Basic understanding of wiki markup.

### **Quality Assurance**

Quality assurance **** or bug testing isn't the most glamorous aspect of game design, but it's a vital one.\
Anyone can be a QA tester! Of course, prior experience with game or software QA is always a plus.

To learn more about how to contribute to QA, read our [bug submission guide](bug-submission.md).

### **Other Ways You Can Help**

If the other three options aren't your cup of tea, there are still ways you can help the project.\
****For example, you can:

* Direct interested parties to the Nexus Forever [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/nexusforever).
* Direct people with questions to the [wiki landing page](../../).
* Gently correct misinformation about the project wherever you see it.
* Spread the word about the project (just be careful about where--we want to avoid trolls).
* Thank the developers for their hard work, and show your enthusiasm about their progress!
