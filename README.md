# Main Page

NexusForever is a server emulator for the defunct MMORPG WildStar which was developed by Carbine and published by NCSoft.\
The goal of NexusForever is to recreate the WildStar server exactly as it existed at the time of its shutdown.\
NexusForever is an open source project, meaning anyone can contribute, no contribution is too small!

#### I'm a player and want to play on a NexusForever server.

If you are wanting to play on a NexusForever server checkout the [client installation guide](installation/client-connection-guide.md).

#### I'm a developer or server hoster and want to setup my own NexusForever server.

If you are wanting to setup your own NexusForever server checkout the server installation guides for both [Windows](installation/server-install-guide-windows.md) and [Linux](installation/server-install-guide-linux.md).

As NexusForever is still in heavy development no support for publicly hosted servers will be given, expect things to break!

#### I'm a developer and want to contribute to the NexusForever project.

If you are wanting to contribute to NexusForever checkout the [contributing](getting-started/contributing/) and [documentation](broken-reference) sections.
